        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Darlene Vaquez, I was born and raised in Riverside, California. I was fortunate enough to stay in my hometown and very close to my family while attending the University of California, Riverside. I had an option to attend various colleges in California however it had been a lifelong dream to attend University of California, Riverside as I grew up close to it and watched its success. This was an important factor for me to be able to stay close to home because family means everything to me. Being accepted into the University of California, Riverside was a great accomplishment since I worked so hard in my grade school years to be able to further my education. However, as a first generation student I have faced many challenges when it comes to college education. This was a totally new environment in which I was not accustomed to at all. Although the adjustment was difficult I have been able to continue with my education and I will forever be grateful for the opportunities I have as a first generation college student.<br><br>

        I have always loved expressing my creativity in different ways such as: creating clothes, doing nail art and designing. My hobbies always change around as I love trying and doing new things. However, something I have always loved doing was watching movies and embodying a movie critic while giving my own rating. I am also a theme park conosur which I also believe my creativity shines through. An important aspect in choosing my career is being able to connect this creativity to my career. This connects to my personal goals since I want to better myself and my own mentality to better succeed in life and my education. A huge personal goal I have been working on is to stop procrastinating not only with school work but anything for my own well being. I also want to step out of my comfort zone and stop being so reserved in the case that I am too shy to function. This goes along with taking care of myself and not keeping a lot on my plate. My professional goals include to gain better networking skills, improve my communication skills and ask for more feedback from my peers and educators to further my knowledge.<br><br>

        I currently work at a retail grocery store where I have been for over a year. Although I have had opportunities to leave and do something different, I enjoy working there since it challenges me as a person and employee. I have learned many great skills from customer service to different technologies. I was able to improve my teamwork skills, communication, and public speaking from being at this job. Although it is not what I want to stay in for the rest of my life, I do believe that temporary jobs like this one are important to gain life skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. Even after I quit to go follow my dream the lessons learned with this company will not be forgotten.
